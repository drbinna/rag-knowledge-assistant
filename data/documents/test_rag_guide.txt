RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It works by first searching through a knowledge base to find relevant information, then using that information to generate accurate and contextual responses. The main components of RAG include document processing, embedding generation, vector storage, and language model integration.
